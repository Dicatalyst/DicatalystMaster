        The diagnosis is based on data the physician obtains from three sources, the first being the patient. This includes the patient's perception of his or her symptoms, medical history, family history, occupation, and other relevant facts.

The third source is the data obtained from medical tests, such as a blood test, x ray, or an electrocardiogram.
