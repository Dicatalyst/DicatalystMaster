    <div>Diagnosis and disease mechanisms inform the decisions in this example, yet patient prognosis is the underlying concern. The concern is firstly to correctly identify the few children who, unless they receive urgent treatment targeted at a specific disease, have a high likelihood of poor outcome (disease diagnosis being a highly effective way to improve prognosis in these individuals) and, secondly, to allow the many children with fever who have a high likelihood of a good outcome to recover without disease-targeted interventions.</div>
